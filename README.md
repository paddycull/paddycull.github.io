This is my own personal website/blog. It's built o Jekyll and the theme is based on the excellent <a href="https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy">Chirpy Theme</a>. I've modifed it a bit to my own preference. 

I'll use this blog to post about most PowerShell things I've created, as well as SQL Server and Oracle DBA stuff.
